### Example: Recent which have resolved conflict

- During working in `Cisco` we have the requirement to get the multi-tenancy instead of single tenant vs multi tenant based architecture so for that
2 senior one was in my team as lead and one was in counterpart was projecting different solution, one was based on MQTT pub-sub model based and other one was based on 
Web-socket message communication based along with using of RB Mq. so for that
i first arrange the individual meeting did the open discussion the pro and cons of each approach 
and then i arrange the meeting where i tried to flip the design approaches for on each other side and did open communication to identify the limitation of each design from other side and also collected the point which fits in to current requirement with minimum impact on backward compatibility breaking. 
So eventually we find the limitations in both the design and came up with hybrid design where pub-sub and WebSocket both were used and also it kept the backward compatibility intact.

- While working in `netapp` I encountered one of the members who was having lots of knowledge about the product was not sharing the information to the new member and it was affecting the productivity and delivery of the project due to that there were stated the conflict b/w those members. When i did one on one to identify the situation it was from one side the appreciation was missing and from other side the willingness and the fear of sharing the knowledge was found.
So i took preventive measure and action on this situation 
- Appreciation and credit of of the team member if anyone is helping you
- Sharing knowledge through tech talk and by setting the goal.
- For senior member to mentor one person in area which they are expert so that that also can move to new opportunity and others can grow.

- In `ABB` i handled one customer issue which was from reliace refinary where the production was halted due to one CI was starting exactly after 49 days we had intially problem to understand the problem but it was happening due to counter oveflow which was causing the CI to start. Though it was an static anaysis warnning but was ignored during development.


### Example: Explain the difficult customer escalation you have encountered and how did you resolve it
- In `Cisco` in the edge intelligence project we got one customer case when there was low bandwidths the data pipeline communication was crashing the router and it was app was starting several time but the same application where the other data center was present was not having the issue. First of all, it was very difficult to reproduce the issue, as initially we were not knowing its happening due to low bandwidth. So we restricted bandwidth locally in the lab with 5g networked based communication and then we reduced the bandwidth and was able to reproduce the issue, the issue when found it was using data pipeline with destination as azure cloud for that we were using open source lib from azure in that queue was crashing and they were not exposing the queue control to the application. so we posted the issue with all the logs to them to fix the issue but as an solution we propose buffer mechanism in application to control the pressure on outbound and fixed that issue. We also exposed the queue configuration to the user to configure and queue count and max memory to allocate whichever is minimum for handling the pressure so that the overall memory will be predictable. We also try to analyze the approach of integrating DB where the que data can be managed in SQ lite but that was not needed for any of the customer.
- flood of the event which was overwhelming the cloud application by lots of pipline status which was flucatuating. So we implemented the buffer oveload event and it was buffer drop event and start dropping the packet rather processing it for every event.

- In `NetApp` we encounter the issue during upgrade as we do the mounting of the image and unmounting of the image as part of validation but that was causing memory leak as unmonting was not happening and without retrying again so because of lots of mount point it was causing the memory leak as the customver was calling the validation script so many time to validate the system and keep the calcuate the helth of the running system and it was rebooting node many time which was causing the failover again and again.

- In `NetApp` we had lot of issue realated to Pasue event becaue the system upgrade was pausing due to so amany several issue in storage stystem despite of having lot of prechec during run time still those issue can arrive and running upgrade can go into pause state and it require again user intervanetion to come out of it. So to reduce lot of user intervantion for the pause cases we did data log analysis throught customver data using smart slove tool which has access to cusotmer generated data mining from data lake and the we identified lot of common problem right now the tool is still adeprting AI process to give good analytics but its still not sufficeient so we arrive on common problems using some time manual analysis and also drafted multiple solution throught out multiple semester release. 

### did you failed any time in your decision making and how did you hanled that failure



### Q1. Can you describe your project management experience and the methodologies you use?
- I have been involved in project management for several years, successfully overseeing projects from initiation to completion across various industries, including IT, software development, and infrastructure.

- I typically use Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban for projects that benefit from iterative development, frequent communication, and quick adaptations to changing requirements.

- When projects demand a more linear, sequential approach, I employ the Waterfall methodology to ensure all phases are carefully defined and executed.

- Additionally, I adapt hybrid approaches that combine elements of Agile and Waterfall, tailoring project management processes to meet the specific needs and constraints of each project.

- Throughout my experience, I have focused on effective risk management, stakeholder communication, resource allocation, and performance tracking, utilizing tools like MS Project, JIRA, and Asana to maintain visibility and control.

- Some time i prefer to do the pair programming which generally help specifically when there is very less knowledge about the product and it also increases the bonding b/w the team members

- I prefer frequent KT tansition and set the goal to individual and 20-30% of work rotation which increases overall team knowledge and also reduces the dependencies on a single person.


### Q2: How do you handle changes in project scope or unexpected changes during a project?

- I begin by evaluating the impact of the change on project timelines, budget, and deliverables so that its implications are fully understood.

- I engage stakeholders by clearly communicating the effects of the change and seeking their approval through a formal change management process.

- When unexpected changes occur, I quickly hold a team meeting to gather input, assess how it affects current tasks, and identify any necessary adjustments.

- To balance the interests of management and the team, I ensure transparent communication, involve key team members in decision-making, and update everyone regularly on progress and any modifications.

- I use project management tools to track changes and progress, making sure that both management and the team are align

### Q3. How do you identify, assess, and manage project risks?

### Q4. What strategies do you follow to manage project deadlines and ensure timely delivery?
- Develop realistic project schedules with clear milestones and task dependencies.

- Continuously monitor progress using project management tools, and adjust plans as needed.

- Prioritize tasks using critical path analysis to focus on high-impact activities.

- Identify potential risks early with regular risk assessments and develop contingency plans.

- Maintain open communication with both the team and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aligned on deadlines.

- Hold regular status meetings to address issues and track progress.

- Allocate resources effectively to support timely task completion.

- Utilize iterative methods, such as Agile sprints, to break projects into manageable segments.

### Q5. How do you ensure effective communication with stakeholders and team members?

- Develop and maintain a `clear communication plan and channel` that outlines how and when updates will be shared.

- Hold `regular meetings` or calls with stakeholders and teams to review progress, address issues, and align on next steps.

- Use collaborative tools like email, project management software, and instant messaging platforms to facilitate ongoing communication.

- Tailor messages to fit the audience, providing detailed technical updates to the team while summarizing key points for higher-level stakeholders.

- Document communications and `share meeting minutes` or status reports to ensure transparency and accountability.

- `Encourage an open-door policy` where team members and stakeholders can raise concerns and provide feedback at any time.

### Q6. How do you prioritize tasks and allocate resources during a project?
- Assess project tasks and deliverables to identify which one is most critical.

- Use prioritization methods like MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't) or critical path analysis to rank tasks.

- Match tasks with team membersâ€™ skills and availability to assign the most appropriate resources.

- Continuously monitor progress and adjust priorities based on changing project needs or unexpected issues.

- Utilize project management tools (e.g., MS Project, JIRA, Asana) to track tasks, resource allocation, and deadlines.

### Q7. How do you monitor project progress and measure success?

- I set clear milestones and key performance indicators (KPIs) at the start of the project to define success.

- I use project management tools like JIRA, MS Project, or Asana to track task completion and progress.

- Regular status meetings and progress reports help me identify any deviations from the plan.

- I monitor project timelines, budgets, and resource usage to ensure alignment with the project plan.

- I gather feedback from the team and stakeholders to assess the quality of the work and overall satisfaction.

- I review deliverables against the defined success criteria to measure whether project outcomes are met.

### Q8. What project management tools or software are you most familiar with?

### Q9. How do you handle conflicts or issues within the project team?
- Address conflicts early by having private discussions with the involved team members to understand their viewpoints.

- Facilitate group meetings if necessary, ensuring all voices are heard and working together to find a resolution.

- Use active listening and mediation techniques to help team members focus on the issues rather than personal differences.

- Align the team around common goals and remind everyone of the project's priorities and vision.

- Follow up after the resolution to confirm that the solution is working and adjust if needed.

### Q10. Can you provide an example of a challenging project and how you overcame obstacles to achieve success?

- I managed a challenging project convert the single tenant architecture to be converted into multi-tenant architecture which was required to change the exsiting communication protocol from IOT-DSA to websocket we also though of using pub-sub but it was having challanges for the scalability. So we defined protocol on using websocket communication for the faster response and communication.


- I organized a kick-off workshop with all stakeholders to clarify project objectives, roles, and responsibilities, which helped align everyone on the same page.

- To reduce ambiguity, we held focused sessions to refine unclear requirements, ensuring that the project scope was well understood by all.

- I introduced agile sprints and regular feedback sessions, which allowed the team to see iterative progress and gradually build confidence in the change process.

- I continuously monitored risks through daily stand-ups and iterative reviews, making necessary adjustments to our plan along the way.

- These strategies improved communication, built team trust, and ultimately led to the successful integration of the systems

### how do you handle the difficult person in a team who is having lot of knowlege but having harsh nature

- Begin with a one-on-one conversation to understand their perspective and explain how their communication style affects the team.

- Recognize and leverage their expertise, encouraging them to mentor others in a constructive, supportive manner.

- Clearly outline behavioral expectations and the impact of harsh interactions on overall team morale.

- Provide coaching or training on effective communication and soft skills, potentially through workshops or professional development.

- Facilitate team-building activities to foster mutual respect and improve interpersonal dynamics.

- Establish regular feedback sessions where both positive contributions and areas for improvement are discussed in a respectful manner.

- If the behavior continues despite efforts, consider involving HR or a higher level of management to address the issue

### How do you hanldle customer escalations and handle the customer needs

- I begin by actively listening to the customer's concerns to fully understand the issue.

- I acknowledge the problem and assure the customer that their issues are taken seriously.

- I quickly assess the situation to determine if immediate action is needed or further investigation is required.

- I communicate internally with the relevant teams to gather information and potential solutions.

- I provide clear, frequent updates to the customer about the status of their escalation.

- I set up the communication channel b/w support, customer and dev team to effectlivly update about the progress and update.

- I try to get the evidence using logs or dump cores to the team members and also ask the enviroment access if they are ready to share with the team.

- I work collaboratively with the team to implement a solution that not only resolves the immediate issue but also prevents recurrence.

- After resolution, I follow up with the customer to ensure their needs have been met and to gather feedback for continuous improvement.
