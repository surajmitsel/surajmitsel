Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the
operators + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5

/*
Sum of two bits can be obtained by performing XOR (^) of the two bits. Carry bit
can be obtained by performing AND (&) of two bits.

Above is simple Half Adder logic that can be used to add 2 single bits. We can
extend this logic for integers. If x and y donâ€™t have set bits at same
position(s), then bitwise XOR (^) of x and y gives the sum of x and y. To
incorporate common set bits also, bitwise AND (&) is used. Bitwise AND of x and
y gives all carry bits. We calculate (x & y) << 1 and add it to x ^ y to get the
required result.
