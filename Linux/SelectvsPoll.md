### I/O multiplexing
I/O multiplexing is a programming technique used in Unix-like operating systems to efficiently manage multiple I/O operations simultaneously without blocking. 

It allows a single process or thread to monitor multiple I/O sources, such as sockets, files, or devices, and efficiently handle any I/O events that occur on these sources.

I/O multiplexing is commonly used in scenarios where a program needs to monitor multiple I/O sources concurrently, such as:

- Networking applications: Handling multiple client connections in a server application.
- Real-time applications: Processing data from multiple sensors or devices simultaneously.
- Asynchronous I/O: Performing non-blocking I/O operations on multiple file descriptors.

The main advantage of I/O multiplexing is that it enables efficient handling of I/O operations without the need for creating multiple threads or processes, which can lead to better resource utilization and scalability in applications. 

This technique is typically implemented using system calls such as select(), poll(), epoll() (Linux-specific), or kqueue() (BSD-specific), which allow the program to wait for events on multiple I/O sources and handle them as they occur.

### Poll vs Select
Both select() and poll() are system calls used for I/O multiplexing in Unix-like operating systems, but they have some differences in their behavior and usage:

- `Interface`:
    - select(): Uses the `fd_set` data structure for monitoring file descriptors.
    - poll(): Uses an array of struct `pollfd` structures for monitoring file descriptors.

- `Number of File Descriptors`:
    - select(): Limited by the maximum number of file descriptors allowed by the system (commonly `1024`).
    - poll(): Limited by the system-imposed limit on the number of file descriptors (usually much higher than select()).    

- `Efficiency`:
    - select(): Less efficient when dealing with a large number of file descriptors due to linear search through the entire set of file descriptors.
    - poll(): Generally more efficient for handling large numbers of file descriptors as it doesn't have the limitations of select().

- `API Flexibility`:
    - select(): Supports a wider range of platforms and is more widely supported across different Unix-like systems.
    - poll(): Provides a more straightforward and flexible interface, making it easier to use and understand.

- `Behavior on EINTR Signal`:
    - select(): The select() call can be restarted after being interrupted by a signal, but the application must handle this explicitly.
    - poll(): The poll() call automatically restarts if it is interrupted by a signal, simplifying error handling in some scenarios.

- `Portability`:
    - select(): More portable and available on a wider range of Unix-like systems.
    - poll(): Less portable, as it is not available on all Unix-like systems, particularly older ones.

In summary, while both select() and poll() serve similar purposes of I/O multiplexing, poll() generally offers better performance and a more flexible interface compared to select(), but select() is more widely supported across different platforms. The choice between them often depends on specific application requirements and compatibility considerations.
