# Pub-Sub Model: Types of Topics

## 1. Basic Topics

- **Description**: Simple, flat text-based channels for message broadcasting.
- **Use Case**: General-purpose pub-sub scenarios, such as news updates or notifications where all subscribers need the same data.


## 2. Hierarchical Topics

- **Description**: Structured topics with multiple levels, separated by a delimiter (e.g., `/` or `.`), representing different categories or sections.
- **Use Case**: Useful in organized, multi-level data systems such as IoT (e.g., `building/room/temperature`).


## 3. Pattern-Based or Wildcard Topics

### Single-Level Wildcard (`+`)

- **Description**: Matches one level in the topic hierarchy (e.g., `home/+/temperature`).
- **Use Case**: Subscribing to multiple related topics, like temperature updates from different rooms.

### Multi-Level Wildcard (`#`)

- **Description**: Matches multiple levels in the topic hierarchy (e.g., `home/#`).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for broad subscriptions across related topics (e.g., all sensors in a building).

## 4. Partitioned Topics

- **Description**: Topics are divided into partitions, enabling parallel processing for scalability.
- **Use Case**: High-throughput applications needing horizontal scalability, such as event streams or analytics.


## 5. Exclusive or Direct Topics

- **Description**: Ensures that only one subscriber processes each message; the message is removed after consumption.
- **Use Case**: Task queues or systems where each message is handled by only one subscriber, such as order processing.


## 6. Broadcast Topics

- **Description**: Messages are delivered to all subscribers, including those offline when the message was published.
- **Use Case**: Used for critical announcements or notifications that all subscribers must receive, like emergency alerts.

## 7. Retained Topics

- **Description**: Retains the last message for each topic, ensuring new subscribers immediately receive it.
- **Use Case**: Status or configuration updates, where new subscribers need the most recent information.

## 8. Delayed or Scheduled Topics

- **Description**: Holds messages until a specified time before delivering them to subscribers.
- **Use Case**: Useful for reminders, scheduled notifications, or delayed processing.


## 9. Transactional Topics

- **Description**: Supports atomic message delivery, where messages are committed only if a transaction completes successfully.
- **Use Case**: Financial or order processing systems where message consistency is crucial.
