# Topic understanding in pub-sub model

In the pub-sub model, a **topic** is a named channel that acts as a pathway for messages. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers can listen to topics they are interested in, receiving all relevant messages.

## How Topics Work
1. **Topics as Message Channels**:
   - Topics represent categories or types of messages (e.g., `weather-updates`, `stock-prices`).
   - They can be predefined or dynamically created based on requirements.

2. **Publishers Send Messages to Topics**:
   - Publishers only need the topic name to post messages.
   - They do not need to know who the subscribers are.

3. **Subscribers Listen to Topics**:
   - Subscribers express interest in topics by subscribing.
   - When a message is published to a subscribed topic, the subscriber receives it.

4. **Message Delivery**:
   - The pub-sub system ensures that all active subscribers to a topic receive each published message.

## Benefits of Using Topics
- **Loose Coupling**: Publishers and subscribers do not need to know each other, increasing flexibility.
- **Scalability**: Topics allow the system to scale as subscribers and publishers can be added or removed independently.
- **Flexibility**: Multiple subscribers can receive the same data without duplicating the publisher's effort.

## Example Use Case
A live sports scores system could have topics like `football-scores`, `basketball-scores`, and `tennis-scores`. Subscribers interested only in football can subscribe to `football-scores`, receiving relevant updates without unnecessary messages.
