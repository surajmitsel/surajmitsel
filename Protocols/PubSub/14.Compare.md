# Comparison of RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and MQTT

| Feature/Aspect         | RabbitMQ                                | Apache Kafka                          | MQTT                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Type**               | Message Broker                          | Distributed Event Streaming Platform  | Lightweight Messaging Protocol         |
| **Model**              | Push  | Pull  | Push  |
| **Protocol**           | AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)| Custom binary protocol over TCP       | MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) |
| **Design**             | Message delivery guarantees, routing, flexible message queuing | High-throughput, low-latency, real-time data streaming | Designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks |
| **Primary Use Case**   | Complex routing, reliable message delivery, various messaging patterns | Event sourcing, log aggregation, real-time analytics, stream processing | IoT applications, sensor networks, mobile devices |
| **Message Delivery Guarantees** | At-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once (with configuration) | At-least-once, exactly-once (with idempotent producers and transactional writes) | QoS 0: At most once, QoS 1: At least once, QoS 2: Exactly once |
| **Performance**        | Can be impacted by complex routing and message persistence | High throughput, low latency | Lightweight and efficient |
| **Scalability**        | Scales vertically and horizontally with careful configuration | Scales horizontally with partitioning and replication | Scales well for IoT applications with many clients |
| **Ecosystem**          | Rich set of features and plugins, supports multiple protocols (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, etc.) | Strong ecosystem with Kafka Streams, Kafka Connect, KSQL | Wide range of client libraries, brokers like Mosquitto, HiveMQ, EMQX |
| **Ease of Use**        | Good documentation and community support | Steeper learning curve, extensive documentation, active community | Simple and easy to implement, growing ecosystem |
| **Typical Use Cases**  | Enterprise messaging, task scheduling, background job processing, complex routing and message transformation | Real-time data streaming and analytics, event sourcing, log aggregation, distributed data pipelines | IoT and M2M communication, sensor data collection, telemetry, mobile messaging, real-time updates |
| **Messages per Second**| Tens of thousands (varies with configuration and hardware) | Millions (with proper configuration and hardware) | Tens of thousands (varies with broker implementation and hardware) |
