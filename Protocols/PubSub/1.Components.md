# Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) Model: Components

---

## Overview of Pub-Sub Model

The pub-sub model is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages to a central broker, and subscribers receive messages by subscribing to specific topics. This approach decouples the message producers from the message consumers, enhancing scalability and flexibility in distributed systems.

## Components of the Pub-Sub Model

### 1. Publisher
- **Role**: Sends messages to specified topics without knowing who the subscribers are.
- **Function**: Publishes messages and leaves delivery to the message broker.
- **Example**: A sensor in an IoT system sending temperature data to a `sensor/temperature` topic.

### 2. Subscriber
- **Role**: Receives messages from topics to which it has subscribed.
- **Function**: Listens for messages from its subscribed topics without knowing the message source.
- **Example**: A monitoring application subscribing to `sensor/temperature` to receive temperature updates.

### 3. Message Broker (Event Bus)
- **Role**: Manages message routing between publishers and subscribers.
- **Function**: Filters, delivers, and manages messages between topics and subscribers, decoupling publishers and subscribers.
- **Example**: MQTT broker, Kafka, RabbitMQ.

### 4. Topic (or Channel)
- **Role**: A named category where messages are published, and subscribers can subscribe to receive specific data.
- **Function**: Allows categorizing messages for filtering and organizing subscriber data.
- **Example**: Topics like `news/sports`, `sensor/humidity`, or `device/alerts`.

### 5. Message
- **Role**: The actual data sent by a publisher and received by subscribers.
- **Function**: Can contain various data formats, such as text, JSON, or binary, depending on application requirements.
