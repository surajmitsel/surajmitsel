# MQTT Publisher and Subscriber Example in Python

This document provides examples of a simple MQTT publisher and subscriber implemented in Python using the `paho-mqtt` library. 

For communication, MQTT uses two ports reserved at the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA): 
TCP/IP port 1883 for unencrypted communication, and 
TCP/IP port 8883 for SSL-encrypted communication.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed and then install the `paho-mqtt` library with the following command:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```

## MQTT Publisher Example

This Python script acts as an MQTT publisher, connecting to an MQTT broker and publishing a message to a specified topic.
```py
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

# MQTT Broker details

#Explanation
#Broker: This example uses broker.hivemq.com, a free public MQTT broker. You can replace this with another MQTT broker URL if needed.
#Topic: The publisher sends messages to the topic test/topic.
#Publishing Loop: The script publishes the message "Hello, MQTT!" every 5 seconds.

broker = 'broker.hivemq.com'  # Public MQTT broker for testing
port = 1883
topic = "test/topic"

# Create a client instance
client = mqtt.Client("PythonPublisher")

# Connect to the broker
client.connect(broker, port)

# Publish a message to the topic
def publish_message():
    while True:
        message = "Hello, MQTT!"
        result = client.publish(topic, message)
        
        # result: [0, 1]
        status = result[0]
        if status == 0:
            print(f"Sent '{message}' to topic '{topic}'")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to send message to topic {topic}")
        
        time.sleep(5)  # Publish every 5 seconds

publish_message()
```

## MQTT Subscriber 

```py
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

#Explanation
#Callback Function: The on_message function is called when a message is received on the subscribed topic. It prints the message content.
#loop_forever(): Keeps the subscriber running and listening for messages indefinitely.

# MQTT Broker details
broker = 'broker.hivemq.com'  # Public MQTT broker for testing
port = 1883
topic = "test/topic"

# Define the callback function for received messages
def on_message(client, userdata, message):
    print(f"Received message: '{message.payload.decode()}' on topic '{message.topic}'")

# Create a client instance
client = mqtt.Client("PythonSubscriber")

# Connect to the broker
client.connect(broker, port)

# Subscribe to the topic
client.subscribe(topic)

# Attach the callback function to the client
client.on_message = on_message

# Keep the client listening for messages
print("Listening for messages...")
client.loop_forever()

```
